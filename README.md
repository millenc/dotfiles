# Dotfiles

Just my dotfiles (WIP). I'm trying out different things and experimenting with the tools, so don't take this as an example on how to do things. Currently it includes configs for:

* i3-gaps
* rofi (app launcher)
* rxvt
* spacemacs

## Installation

The uber-crappy boostrap script has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and probably won't work in any other system.

1. Clone this repo into `~/.dotfiles` (important to keep this name, as some paths are hardcoded to it).
2. `mv` into the folder and run the `bootstrap.sh` script.

## Credit

The i3 configuration is based on the [i3-starter-pack](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/i3-starterpack) sample repo.
